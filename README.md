# ENVIEW
Prerequisites:
Python and cx_Oracle:

Ensure Python is installed on your machine.
Install cx_Oracle by running:
Copy code
pip install cx_Oracle
Oracle Database:

Install and set up an Oracle Database.
Create a user and grant necessary privileges to access the database.
Code Execution:
1. Oracle Connection String:
Replace 'username/password@localhost:1521/service_name' in the code with your Oracle database credentials:
'username' is your Oracle database username.
'password' is the password for the specified user.
'localhost:1521/service_name' points to your Oracle server (host:port/service_name).
2. Code Structure:
The provided code snippet establishes a connection to an Oracle database and creates two tables, events and alerts.
3. Running the Code:
Copy the modified code snippet into a Python file, e.g., oracle_integration.py.
Make sure your Oracle database is running.
Execute the Python script using a Python interpreter or an IDE.
4. Execution Details:
Connection: The cx_Oracle.connect() function establishes a connection to the Oracle database using the provided connection string.
Cursor Creation: conn.cursor() creates a cursor object to execute SQL statements.
Table Creation: cursor.execute() runs SQL commands to create two tables, events and alerts, with specified columns and data types.
Committing Changes: conn.commit() commits the changes to the database.
Outcome:
Upon successful execution, the code creates the necessary tables in your Oracle database (events and alerts) that are structured to store event and alert data. These tables will be available in your Oracle database for storing and retrieving information related to events and alerts from your application.

Make sure to replace the placeholder values in the connection string with your actual Oracle database credentials before running the code. After execution, verify in your Oracle database that the tables events and alerts have been created with the defined columns.


 Importing cx_Oracle:
python
Copy code
import cx_Oracle
Imports the cx_Oracle library, enabling connectivity between Python and Oracle databases.
2. Establishing a Connection:
python
Copy code
conn = cx_Oracle.connect('username/password@localhost:1521/service_name')
Connects to the Oracle database using the provided connection string. Modify 'username/password@localhost:1521/service_name' with your actual database credentials, host, port, and service name.
3. Creating a Cursor:
python
Copy code
cursor = conn.cursor()
Creates a cursor object to interact with the Oracle database. The cursor allows executing SQL commands within the established connection.
4. Creating Tables (events and alerts):
python
Copy code
cursor.execute('''
    CREATE TABLE events (
        id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL AS IDENTITY,
        timestamp TIMESTAMP,
        is_driving_safe NUMBER,
        vehicle_id NUMBER,
        location_type VARCHAR2(50),
        alert_generated NUMBER DEFAULT 0
    )
''')

cursor.execute('''
    CREATE TABLE alerts (
        id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT ON NULL AS IDENTITY,
        location_type VARCHAR2(50),
        timestamp TIMESTAMP
    )
''')
Executes SQL statements to create two tables in the Oracle database: events and alerts.
events table stores driving event data such as timestamp, safety status, vehicle ID, location type, and an indicator for generated alerts.
alerts table is designed to store alert data, specifically location type and timestamp.
5. Committing Changes:
python
Copy code
conn.commit()
Commits the changes made in the database. This ensures that the table creation commands are finalized and persisted in the Oracle database.
Execution and Outcome:
Running the Code: Execute the Python script after replacing the connection string with your Oracle database credentials.
Outcome: Upon successful execution, the script establishes a connection to the Oracle database and creates events and alerts tables, providing the infrastructure to store and retrieve data related to driving events and alerts within the Oracle database.
This code snippet primarily focuses on creating the necessary database schema (tables) for storing event and alert information within an Oracle database by utilizing Python with the cx_Oracle library. Adjustments and expansions can be made based on specific application requirements, like adding constraints, indexes, or additional columns, to suit your use case.
